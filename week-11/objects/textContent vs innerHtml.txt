innerHTML allows content including html elements and nodes to be inserted into a dom.
This is a security issue in this as it would allow users to insert malicious scripts into the html page that can be called
and run, much like a CSRF attack.

textContent inserts content into the html page as text only, so if html tags are used in the content to be inserted
it will be inserted only as text.
