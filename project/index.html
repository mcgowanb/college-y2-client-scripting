                <h1>Welcome to New York</h1>
                <p>The City of New York, often called New York City, New York, or simply The City, is the most populous
                    city in the United States. Located at the southern tip of the state of New York, the city is the
                    centre of the New York metropolitan area, one of the most populous urban agglomerations in the
                    world. With a U.S. Census Bureau-estimated 2015 population of 8,550,405 distributed over a land area
                    of just 305 square miles (790 km2), New York is also the most densely populated major city in the
                    United States. A global power city, New York City exerts a significant impact upon commerce,
                    finance, media, art, fashion, research, technology, education, and entertainment, its fast pace
                    defining the term New York minute. Home to the headquarters of the United Nations, New York is an
                    important centre for international diplomacy and has been described as the cultural and financial
                    capital of the world.</p>

                    <p>Situated on one of the world's largest natural harbours, New York City consists of five boroughs,
                        each of which is a separate county of New York State. The five boroughs – Brooklyn, Queens,
                        Manhattan, The Bronx, and Staten Island – were consolidated into a single city in 1898. The city
                        and its metropolitan area constitute the premier gateway for legal immigration to the United
                        States, and as many as 800 languages are spoken in New York, making it the most linguistically
                        diverse city in the world. By 2015 estimates, the New York City metropolitan region remains by a
                        significant margin the most populous in the United States, as defined by both the Metropolitan
                        Statistical Area (20.2 million residents and the Combined Statistical Area (23.7 million
                        residents). In 2013, the MSA produced a gross metropolitan product (GMP) of nearly US$1.39
                        trillion, while in 2012, the CSA generated a GMP of over US$1.55 trillion, both ranking first
                        nationally by a wide margin and behind the GDP of only twelve and eleven countries,
                        respectively. </p>

                    <h2>Food</h2>
                    <p>New York City's food culture includes a variety of international cuisines influenced by the
                        city's immigrant history. Central European and Italian immigrants brought bagels, cheesecake,
                        and New York-style pizza into the city, while Chinese and other Asian restaurants, sandwich
                        joints, trattorias, diners, and coffeehouses have become ubiquitous. </p>
